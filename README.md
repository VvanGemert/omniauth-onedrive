# Omniauth Onedrive

A OneDrive / Windows Live strategy for OmniAuth. Created according the OneDrive documentation. A Windows Live app needs to be created in the Developer Center - https://dev.onedrive.com/app-registration.htm.

More information about the OAuth authentication method can be found here:
https://dev.onedrive.com/auth/msa_oauth.htm

This gem is slighty based on the version of Plexinc (https://github.com/plexinc/omniauth-live-connect), but I found out after I completed and implemented the gem.

## Installation

Before you can get started you will need to add your platform and set your redirect uri's correctly in the
apps dashboard. You can get there by going to: https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/#/appList and click on your application.
If you don't have an application yet, you will need to create it in the same dashboard.

Step two is adding this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-onedrive'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-onedrive

## Usage

    # Add to OmniAuth::Builder do
    provider :onedrive, ENV['live_client_id'], ENV['live_secret_key'],
      { :scope => 'wl.signin wl.basic' }
